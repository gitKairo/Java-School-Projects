# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

The program defines two classes, Circle and Rectangle, and implements their methods to display the properties of two objects of each class. 
The main method creates two Circle objects, displays their properties, and prints which one is larger based on their area.
Then, it creates two Rectangle objects, displays their properties, and prints which one is larger based on their area.

## Analysis Steps

The assignment asks you to create two classes, Circle and Rectangle, which represent geometric shapes. 
You need to implement methods to display the properties of these shapes, such as their area.
To analyze this assignment, I started by understanding what properties and methods are required for each class. 
For example, a Circle class might need properties such as radius and methods such as a calculation for its area.

### Design

Class design: I started by creating the blueprint for each class, Circle and Rectangle, and defining their properties, such as radius. 
I also defined the methods that I needed to implement, such as the calculation of area and the display of properties.




### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Create two circle objects with different radii and colors, verify that area is calculated correctly and that each circle shows the correct properties.

I verified the Rectangle class by creating rectangles with different lengths, widths, and colors. Then that the areas were calculated correctly.

I ended by testing that my main method was creating objects and displaying each class correctly.

## Notes

I made a few Logical errors like using the wrong formulas to calculate the radius at first. As well as syntax errors like an extra semi colon.
