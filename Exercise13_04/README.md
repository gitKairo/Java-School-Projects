using the subclass GregorianCalendar.

## Analysis Steps

I realized I needed to import the Java Scanner class if I was going to be able to get user input as well as import the Java Calendar class and the 
GregorianCalendar subclass. I used multiple methods to create variables that would be used later in my program. 

### Design

I had to use multiple classes and methods to build my calendar one object at a time as well as many variables created in my class and the imported classes.

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
