# Hangman Drawing

 The project is a JavaFX program that displays a drawing for the Hangman game. 
 The program creates a canvas and uses the GraphicsContext class to draw a scaffold and a stick figure representing the Hangman.

## Analysis Steps

Firstly, I created a GUI using JavaFX. This involved creating a window, a canvas for the drawing, and other UI elements as needed.
Then I designed the hangman drawing it self which involed creating the scaffold and the stick figure.

### Design

I identified the components needed for the program, a window to display the drawing, a canvas to draw on, a GraphicsContext to draw with, and UI elements to allow the program to run.

### Testing

I verified that the GUI elements are displaying correctly and that the user can interact with the UI as expected.

Then I tested the drawing, verifying that the hangman drawing is displaying correctly on the canvas. I tested the different parts of the drawing to ensure that they are being added in the correct order and that they are being displayed correctly.

## Notes

Using GraphicsContext took some getting used to in the beginning.
